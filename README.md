# Scheduling-Algorithm-Simulation
The scheduling algorithm simulation is an assignment created for CS-3100,
Operating Systems and Concurrency. The assignment allowed students to develop an understanding for the 
different scheduling algorithms that an operating system might employ: 
Round Robin, First Come First Serve, Shortest Job First, and Priority

The code runs from a single driver file "Assign5.java." This code runs a simulation which generates a series
of processes and schedulers (all schedulers inherit from the same scheduler base class) emanating from a single 
"platform" class.
